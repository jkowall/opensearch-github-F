## Merging PRs
OpenSearch pull requests are merged after there is approval from at least 1 maintainer. 

Each PR should have:

* A descriptive title, known as ["commit message"][good-commit-msg]. In summary:
  * Limit the title to 50 characters
  * Capitalize the title
  * Do not end the title with a period
  * Use the imperative mood in the title
* A description of the problem it is solving. It could be simply a reference to the corresponding issue, e.g. `Resolves #123`.
* A summary of changes made to solve the problem. Explain _what_ and _why_ instead of _how_.

Merge the PR by using "Squash and merge" option on Github. Avoid creating merge commits.
After the merge make sure referenced issues were closed.
